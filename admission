# Create a function for school admission system. 
# A student can apply for admission by providing their name, age, email, grade
# The function should check if the student is eligible for admission based 
# on grade
# If the student is eligible, 
# the function should return a message saying "Congratulations {name}, 
# you have been admitted to our school"
# If the student is not eligible, the function should return a message saying
#  "Sorry {name}, you are not eligible for admission"
# If the student is eligible, the function should also return the student's 
# profile which includes their name, age, email, and grade.
# If the student is not eligible, the function should not return the profile.
# The function should also store the student's profile in a local storage
# (a dictionary) if they are eligible for admission.
